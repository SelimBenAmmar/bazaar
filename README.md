# Bazaar

Bazaar is a project that was launched after winning the challenge Elpida in the Startup Weekend Refugees 2017 in Paris, France. We are a team composed of a designer, 2 managers and 2 engineers in computer science. The aim is to help the association Elpida to better distribute its goods to refugees who come to Greece. 

The final project will include:
- An app for the refugees to connect to their personal accounts. They can check their purchase history and see how much points are left in their accounts.
- A software/website for the volunteers to make the refugees' purchases and update stocks.

The project is currently under construction.
